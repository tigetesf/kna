“It is hard to overstate the impact that William Lane Craig has had for the 
cause of Christ. He is simply the finest Christian apologist of the last half 
century, and his academic work justifies ranking him among the top 1 percent 
of practicing philosophers in the Western world. Besides that, he is a winsome 
ambassador for Christ, an exceptional debater, and a man with the heart of 
an evangelist. I know him well and can say that he lives a life of integrity and 
lives out what he believes. I do not know of a single thinker who has done 
more to raise the bar of Christian scholarship in our generation than Craig. 
He is one of a kind, and I thank God for his life and work.”
